# Instanews Application - Javascript, JQuery, AJAX and APIs

This project was designed to demonstrate the presentation of AJAX data calls using an API to the New York Times.

The website was built using mobile-first responsive web design and designed for mobile, tablet and desktop screen 
resolutions.

##Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- AJAX
- APIs

##Personal Learnings

The data requirements from the project concepts allowed me to investigate the process for obtaining an API key 
and to set up the connection to the data server using AJAX and JQuery.

JQuery was used on the resulting data set to filter to a required result allowing me to understand JavaScript 
and JQuery array and object manipulation.

Understanding of AJAX, JQuery DOM manipulation and CSS3 was gained through data set presentation using and 
responsive web design.
