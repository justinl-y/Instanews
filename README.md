<kbd>![Image of Instanews](https://github.com/justinl-y/project-02/blob/master/readme-screenshot.png "Instanews")</kbd>

This project was designed to demonstrate the presentation of AJAX data calls using an API to the New York Times.

The website was built using mobile-first responsive web design and designed for mobile, tablet and desktop screen 
resolutions.

##Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- AJAX
- APIs
- SASS
- GULP

##Personal Learnings

The data requirements from the project concepts allowed me to investigate the process for obtaining an API key 
and to set up the connection to the data server using AJAX and JQuery.

JQuery was used on the resulting data set to filter to a required result allowing me to understand JavaScript 
and JQuery array and object manipulation.

Understanding of AJAX, JQuery DOM manipulation and CSS3 was gained through data set presentation using the principles 
of mobile-first responsive web design.

Understanding of SASS was gained through the process of creating minified CSS files from SASS partials.

GULP was used to add developer functionality for task automation.  Understanding of the creation of minified 
CSS and JavaScript files was gained through the install and configuration process of GULP packages as well as 'linted'
 JavaScript files from the implementation of eslint gulp tasks.
